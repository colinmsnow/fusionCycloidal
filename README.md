There are more videos and pictures in the media folder :)

Cycloidal reductions drives are basically a type of gearbox... but without gears per-say. They have little backlash meaning they're used in robots and machine tools. They have a really high ratio density and a high tooth engagement, meaning they're good for heaps of torque.

## How to:
You can install the script by clicking the "Add-ins" button in Fusion:

You can change the design parameters be editing the top of the file:

Happy building! I'd love to see what you can do with them.
